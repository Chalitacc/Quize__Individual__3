# Indivdual Assignment 3


 
## Project Description
I made a Harry Potter quize as my third inidivudal assignment. I found the quize questions here: https://www.signupgenius.com/groups/harry-potter-trivia.cfm and used the one that was most applicabale for me. 


# #Navigation 
The first page you will see is the intro page where you have to press the button to start the quize. There are 8 questions and three options that you will have to choose from. The button down on the page will tell you which questions you are on and how many questions it is left. You click on the button to go to the next page. When you are done with the quize, you wil see your results. You will also see which answer you chose by the highlight and if it is correct or not by the checkmark on the side of the question. You will aslo be able to see what is the correct answer and which is the wrong answer. At the top of the page you will be able to start the quize again.
